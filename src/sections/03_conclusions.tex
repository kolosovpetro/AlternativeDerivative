In this manuscript, we have reviewed an approach to get derivative of odd-power using identity in partial derivatives
of the function $f$ evaluated at fixed point $(u,u) \in \mathbb{R}^2.$
Main results of the manuscript can be validated using Mathematica programs available online at~\cite{kolosov2022another}.
