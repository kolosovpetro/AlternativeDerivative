This manuscript provides another approach to get derivative of odd-power, that is approach based on partial derivatives
of the polynomial function $f_y$ defined as
\[
    f_{y} (x, z) = \sum_{k=1}^{z} \sum_{r=0}^{y} \mathbf{A}_{y,r} k^r (x-k)^r
\]
where $x, z\in \mathbb{R}$, $y$ is fixed constant $y \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbf{A}_{y,r}$ are real coefficients.
